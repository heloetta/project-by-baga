## This is a 1340 project
## We are going to build an Accounting System
## Problem statement
- Currently we find our students sometimes have no ideas about the expense and income or have a hard time trace the records, which result in poor use of the money.This unbalanced financial issue should be tackled and an accounting system will help a lot.          
## Problem settings
- Basic recording part
  income and expenses records
- Basic information: amount, date, types of income or expense (e.g. food, game,salary, etc.), account (e.g cash, bank card, credit card, etc.),remarks; 
  We assume that a expense/income has these 5 basic feature(excluded id).And we define a class Record in Record.h for the sets of data.
And we thought using linked list is a goodchoice to manner the data.So we define a class Node in Record.h through which we apply the use   of dynamic array.
- the records should be added,deleted,edited and viewed
  We store all our records in a file named "records.txt" line by line below the sub values and to make changes.The output data after using a function will cover the previous file.We think this kind of setting reduce the amount of new files we will use thus for us to trace the records more easily.
- Also we design the interface of the output so it will be clearer for the user to see.
- advanced functions
  1. analysis of financial state including monthly/year income, outcome and Engel's cofficient
     We think various kinds of analysis will help user get more aware of his financial status.
  2. set the monthly burget and check if the user need to save money linerly
     We assume that we used money in a linear way.
     (e.g. if user's monthly burget is $3000,it will send alert if he has spent more than $1500 for the first half of the month )
- Makefile
  We use a makefile to help compile all the .cpp&.h files so technically you just first enter make main and ./main in your linux system.
- Problem cause

We want to make an accounting system to help ourselves to better manage our money.

## functionalities and future
1. add new records
   - this function allows users to input all the information expect ID of a new record and then append it into the "record.txt".The default of ID is 0,which is not imported before view.
2. edit records
   - this function can be only used after viewing the records.However, if the user add a new record after viewing,he/she needs to view again before editing records.
   - this function allows users to edit one information in a record with the ID of the record in the latest viewed records from the records.txt.
3. delete records 
   - this function can be only used after viewing the records.However, if the user add a new record after viewing,he/she needs to view again before deleting records.
   - this function allows users to delete a whole record with the ID of the record in the latest viewed records from the records.txt.
4. view records
   - this function allows users to view all the records in the records.txt sorted by date,account,type,income or expense and amount.
   - this function will assign the ID of records and is necessary for editing and deleting.
5. analyse financial state
   - this function can analyze the yearly/monthly income,expenses and Engel's cofficient.
   - this function will ask users to choose which month/year and what to analyse.
6. check burget for this month
   - this function will ask users to input today's date and the burget for this month and judge if the users need to save money linerly.It will print "WARNING!SAVE YOUR MONEY" or "safe".
0. quit
   - quit the accounting system
